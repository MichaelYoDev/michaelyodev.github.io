Additionally, Schlanman&rsquo;s hard photos series inspired me, as his photos—some on a Powershot like mine—do indeed go hard.
Eventually, I hope to procure an interchangeable lens camera.

Ricoh GR IV



I acquired this camera very recently, and it&rsquo;s already become my favorite everyday carry. The Ricoh GR IV is the newest in the iconic GR series, packing a 25.7-megapixel APS-C BSI CMOS sensor, a redesigned 18.3mm f/2.8-f/16 lens (28mm full-frame equivalent), 5-axis in-body shake reduction, and super-fast operation—all in an even more compact body than its predecessors."><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=/images/icons/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=/images/icons/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=/images/icons/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=manifest href=/images/icons/site.webmanifest><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/main.ab07809a4700d3c2a979c0932a1e21072a467ccf739a9433bedc201f56e334b0.css></head><body><div class=content><header><div class=main><a class=a-image href=https://michaelyodev.github.io/><img src=/images/buttons/m1ch43ly0dev_logo.avif alt=m1ch43ly0.dev></a></div><header-nav><a href=/about/>about</a>

The Ricoh GR IV is the newest in the iconic GR series, packing a 25.7-megapixel APS-C BSI CMOS sensor, a redesigned 18.3mm f/2.8-f/16 lens (28mm full-frame equivalent), 5-axis in-body shake reduction, and super-fast operation—all in an even more compact body than its predecessors.</p><p>Image quality is phenomenal, with rich, natural colors, impressive dynamic range, and strong low-light performance thanks to the new sensor and GR ENGINE 7 processor. It&rsquo;s ideal for street photography, snapshots, and daily shooting, easily pocketable yet delivering pro-level results that far exceed its size.</p><p>It&rsquo;s only slightly larger than my <a href=/gear/cameras/#canon-powershot-sd1200-is>Canon PowerShot SD1200 IS</a> at 4.31 x 2.41 x 1.29 inches and 262 grams, but the leap in capability from such a tiny package still blows me away.</p><p>One of my favorite features is the ability to shoot amazing <a href=https://mikepolys.substack.com/p/why-i-shoot-only-jpg-the-secret-is>SooC</a> JPEG&rsquo;s with built-in image recipes (presets) that often make post-processing unnecessary. The ones I&rsquo;m currently using are:</p><ul><li><a href=https://reggiebphotography.com/blog/The-Most-Versatile-Ricoh-GR-III-GR-IIIx-Film-Simulation-Recipe-Reggies-Color-Negative>Reggie&rsquo;s Color Negative</a></li><li><a href=https://ricohrecipes.com/the-bw-collection/>B&amp;W Negative w/ Red Filter</a></li></ul><p>Since it&rsquo;s still so new to me, I&rsquo;m continuing to explore its features, but I already love the snap focus modes and the intuitive tactile controls. On my wishlist are the official <a href=https://us.ricoh-imaging.com/product/ricoh-gf-2-external-flash/>RICOH GF-2 external flash</a> for better low-light fill and possibly a protective <a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FQ7TYFT>soft case</a>.</p><h2 id=canon-powershot-sd1200-is>Canon PowerShot SD1200 IS</h2><figure><img src=/images/gear/cameras/canonPowershotSD1200IS.avif></figure><p>This is my favorite &ldquo;old&rdquo; camera. The photos I have captured on it hold a very sentimental value to me, and have a certain aesthetic that I really enjoy.</p><p>It features a 10.0-megapixel 1/2.3-inch CCD sensor and the DIGIC 4 image processor, as well as Canon&rsquo;s Optical Image Stabilizer which helps reduce blur in shots with slight motion or sub-par lighting conditions. The 3x optical zoom lens is 6.2-18.6mm (35–105 mm equivalent, f/2.8–4.9).</p><p>It has surprisingly good image quality for portraits, especially with flash in dark environments, although the flash does not have much range. Colors are punchy straight out of camera, and face-detection AF is quick and reliable. The 2.5-inch LCD screen is decent for seeing what you are shooting, and it also has an optical viewfinder.</p><p>The compact size (3.39 x 2.17 x 0.87 inches) and light weight (160 grams with battery) have allowed me to easily slip it into my suit pocket at concerts, or even carry it by hand with the wrist strap.</p><h2 id=nikon-coolpix-l105>Nikon Coolpix L105</h2><figure><img src=/images/gear/cameras/nikonCoolpixL105.avif></figure><p>This was the first &ldquo;big&rdquo; camera that I ever held.</p><p>It has a 12.1-megapixel 1/2.3-inch CCD sensor, slightly better than my Powershot. It has a very nice 5.0-75.0mm NIKKOR lens (equivalent to 28-420mm full frame) with 15x optical zoom and 4x digital zoom, so I can capture all sorts of angles on this camera.</p><p>It features Nikon&rsquo;s vibration reduction and contrast-detect autofocus. Additionally, the pop-up flash is very fun to use and has a very good range.</p><p>For me, the downsides of this camera are mostly about its size. It is fairly large (4.3 x 3.0 x 3.1 inches) and uses 4 AA batteries, bringing the weight to about 430 grams. It isn&rsquo;t the most portable, but when I want to get better photos, use a higher zoom, or have the space available, I may opt for this camera.</p><h2 id=sony-cyber-shot-dsc-w7>Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W7</h2><figure><img src=/images/gear/cameras/sonyCybershotDSCW7.avif></figure><p>I love the aesthetic of this camera, with its large, blocky feel and tactile buttons. The mode switcher is very satisfying to use as well.</p><p>It has a 7.2-megapixel 1/1.8-inch Super HAD CCD sensor—larger than the 1/2.3-inch chips in my other two cameras—and a Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 7.9–23.7 mm lens (38–114 mm equivalent) with 3x optical zoom and f/2.8–5.2 aperture. It has a 2.5-inch LCD screen, as well as an optical viewfinder.</p><p>It is a bit larger than the Powershot (3.58 x 2.36 x 1.46 inches) and about 253 grams with two AA batteries. I do love its blocky feel though.</p><p>Unfortunately, I do not yet have an adapter for the Sony Memory Stick, so I cannot get photos off of the camera. Once I do, I’m excited to see how this camera&rsquo;s photos compare to the others.</p></section><hr><div class=meta>Updated on 00W05</div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><strong>Tagged with:</strong></li><li><a href=/%20tags/gear>gear</a></li><li><a href=/%20tags/photography>photography</a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=toc><strong>Table of contents:</strong><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#ricoh-gr-iv>Ricoh GR IV</a></li><li><a href=#canon-powershot-sd1200-is>Canon PowerShot SD1200 IS</a></li><li><a href=#nikon-coolpix-l105>Nikon Coolpix L105</a></li><li><a href=#sony-cyber-shot-dsc-w7>Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W7</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=footer-wrapper><div class=footer-upper><div class=footer-left><div class=footer-cc>© 2025
