<h2 id="canon-powershot-sd1200-is">Canon PowerShot SD1200 IS</h2>

<p>This is my favorite camera. The photos I have captured on it hold a very sentimental value to me, and have a certain aesthetic that I really enjoy.</p>
<p>It features a 10.0-megapixel 1/2.3-inch CCD sensor and the DIGIC 4 image processor, as well as Canon&rsquo;s Optical Image Stabilizer which helps reduce blur in shots with slight motion or sub-par lighting conditions. The 3x optical zoom lens is 6.2-18.6mm (35–105 mm equivalent, f/2.8–4.9).</p>
<p>It has surprisingly good image quality for photos of people, especially with flash in dark environments, although the flash does not extend very far. Colors are punchy straight out of camera, and face-detection AF is quick and reliable. The 2.5-inch LCD screen is decent for seeing what you are shooting, and it also has an optical viewfinder.</p>
<p>The compact size (3.39 x 2.17 x 0.87 inches) and light weight (160 grams with battery) have allowed me to easily slip it into my suit pocket at concerts, or even carry it by hand with the wrist strap.</p>
<h2 id="nikon-coolpix-l105">Nikon Coolpix L105</h2>

<p>This was the first &ldquo;big&rdquo; camera that I ever held.</p>
<p>It has a 12.1-megapixel 1/2.3-inch CCD sensor, slightly better than my Powershot. It has a very nice 5.0-75.0mm NIKKOR lens (equivalent to 28-420mm for 35mm) with 15x optical zoom and 4x digital zoom, so I can capture all sorts of angles on this camera.</p>
<p>It features Nikon&rsquo;s vibration reduction and contrast-detect autofocus. Additionally, the pop-up flash is very fun to use and has a very good range.</p>
<p>For me, the downsides of this camera are mostly about its size. It is fairly large (4.3 x 3.0 x 3.1 inches) and uses 4 AA batteries, bringing the weight to about 430 grams. It isn&rsquo;t the most portable, so I usually find myself slipping the Powershot into my pocket, but when I want to get better photos, use a higher zoom, or have the room available, I will opt for this camera.</p>
<h2 id="sony-cyber-shot-dsc-w7">Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W7</h2>

<p>I love the aesthetic of this camera, with its large, blocky feel and tactile buttons. The mode switcher is very satisfying to use as well.</p>
<p>It has a 7.2-megapixel 1/1.8-inch Super HAD CCD sensor—larger than the 1/2.3-inch chips in my other two cameras—and a Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 7.9–23.7 mm lens (38–114 mm equivalent) with 3x optical zoom and f/2.8–5.2 aperture. It has a 2.5-inch LCD screen, as well as an optical viewfinder.</p>
<p>It is a bit larger than the Powershot (3.58 x 2.36 x 1.46 inches) and about 253 grams with two AA batteries. I do love its blocky feel though.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I do not yet have an adapter for the Sony Memory Stick, so I cannot get photos off of the camera. Once I do, I’m excited to see how this camera&rsquo;s photos compare to the others.</p>
