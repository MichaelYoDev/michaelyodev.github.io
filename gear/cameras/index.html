<p>This is my favorite camera. The photos I have captured on it hold a very sentimental value to me, and have a certain aesthetic that I really enjoy.</p>
<p>It features a 10.0-megapixel 1/2.3-inch CCD sensor and the DIGIC 4 image processor, as well as Canon&rsquo;s Optical Image Stabilizer which helps reduce blur in shots with slight motion or sub-par lighting conditions.</p>
<p>It has surprisingly good image quality for photos of people, especially with flash in dark environments, although the flash does not extend very far.</p>
<p>The compact size (3.39 x 2.17 x 0.87 inches) and light weight (160 grams) have allowed me to easily slip it my suit pocket at concerts, or even carry it by hand with the wrist strap.</p>

<p>I love the aesthetic of this camera, with its large, blocky feel and tactile buttons. The mode switcher is very satisfying to use as well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I do not currently have an adapter for the Sony Memory Stick, so I cannot get the photos off of the camera.</p>
