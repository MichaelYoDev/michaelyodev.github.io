I am a Taiwanese-Brazilian-American (🇹🇼🇧🇷🇺🇸) musician and programmer. Currently a high-school senior, residing in the United States of America.
why make this site?
For the past few years, I have been writing things down in my journal, which wasn&rsquo;t always on me. I wanted to have a place where I could store my musings, explorations, and discoveries.
I have always been somewhat of an analog person, not really accompanying trends or being big on social media. When I discovered the concept of a digital garden, a website made not for sharing online but as a collection of notes and ideas for myself, I knew I had to join the movement and explore the roots of what the web was made for." />

<h2 id="why-make-this-site">why make this site?</h2>
<p>For the past few years, I have been writing things down in my journal, which wasn&rsquo;t always on me. I wanted to have a place where I could store my musings, explorations, and discoveries.</p>
<p>I have always been somewhat of an analog person, not really accompanying trends or being big on social media. When I discovered the concept of a <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden/">digital garden</a>, a website made not for sharing online but as a collection of notes and ideas for myself, I knew I had to join the movement and explore the roots of what the web was made for.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">inspiration</h2>
<p>The first ever blog I stumbled upon was the blog of <a href="https://www.woodbetween.world/">Reece</a>. His blog has writings on a variety of topics from <em>the Lord of the Rings</em> to the property of spin in subatomic particles. It opened my eyes to the realization that writing, even about random topics, can be interesting and even fun to read and write.</p>
<p>Recently, I discovered the website of <a href="https://%E3%83%9E%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A6%E3%82%B9.com/">Marius</a>, as well as the <a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/m1ch43ly0">Merveilles webring</a>. There, I discovered the simplicity that personal sites and blogs can have while still containing lots of character.</p>
<h2 id="how-was-this-site-made">how was this site made?</h2>
<p>This website was made using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and a heavily modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/athul/archie">Archie</a> theme. I played with the idea of having a simple <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">motherf*cking website</a> with just html and css, but I found Hugo to be very fun to work with.</p>
