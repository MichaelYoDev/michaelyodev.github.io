Exploring how I have customized my iPhone 16 Pro to cut distractions, from Focus Modes to monochrome filters, and why I am tempted by minimal e-ink alternatives like the Boox Palma to further reduce screen time.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an era where smartphones are designed to capture our attention, I&rsquo;ve been grappling with my own device dependency. On my iPhone 16 Pro, my average daily screen time hovers around 3 hours. Not too high, but I still feel it pulling me away from real-life priorities. The biggest culprits? Endless YouTube rabbit holes, constant texting, and aimless web surfing. These distractions have hit hardest during my practice sessions, where I need undivided focus but often find myself checking notifications mid-routine. It&rsquo;s led to fragmented concentration, less productive practice sessions, and a nagging sense that my phone can be more of a hindrance than a help.</p>
<p>To combat this, I&rsquo;ve implemented some built-in iOS features to make my iPhone less addictive. While these tweaks aren&rsquo;t a complete cure, they&rsquo;ve helped reclaim some mental space. But lately, I&rsquo;ve been eyeing hardware alternatives, specifically minimal devices with e-ink displays that promise a calmer, less stimulating experience. I absolutely love the e-ink tech from my Kindle; it feels gentle on the eyes and evokes a sense of tranquility that&rsquo;s worlds apart from the vibrant, notification-pinging glow of my iPhone. Below, I&rsquo;ll share my current setup and why devices like the Boox Palma (and a few others) are calling my name.</p>
<h2 id="my-iphone-tweaks-focus-modes-and-grayscale">My iPhone Tweaks: Focus Modes and Grayscale</h2>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s Focus Modes have been a game-changer for tailoring my phone to specific activities. I have three main ones: Practice, School, and Workout. Each allows only essential apps on a one-page setup and limits notifications, silencing the rest. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown:</p>
<h3 id="practice-focus">Practice Focus</h3>
<p>This is for my dedicated practice time.</p>
<p>Apps on the home screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andante (my practice tracker)</li>
<li>TE Tuner (for tuning my instruments)</li>
<li>Voice Memos (to record myself)</li>
<li>Apple Music (for listening to recordings)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notifications are limited to Calendar reminders, so no social media or random pings to derail me.</p>
<p>This focus mode is triggered manually, through the shortcut at the top of each home page.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/posts/practice-focus.avif">
</figure>

<h3 id="school-focus">School Focus</h3>
<p>This focus mode keeps me productive during classes or study sessions.</p>
<p>Apps on the home screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Drive (to access school files)</li>
<li>Infinite Campus (for checking grades)</li>
<li>Canvas (for accessing assignments)</li>
<li>Gmail (for my school email)</li>
<li>Apple Music (for my study playlist)</li>
</ul>
<p>Widgets on the home screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bell Schedule (so I&rsquo;m not late to class)</li>
<li>Homework (see my homework todo list)</li>
<li>Stations (put on a Music station)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notifications come through for the aforementioned apps, so I can stay on top of assignments without extras.</p>
<p>This focus mode is triggered automatically by location when I am at my school, or manually through the shortcut at the top of each home page.</p>

<h3 id="workout-focus">Workout Focus</h3>
<p>This focus mode is for my workouts, whether lifting at the gym or running.</p>
<p>Apps on the home screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fit19 (the gym I frequent)</li>
<li>Apple Fitness (to see my activity)</li>
<li>Podcasts</li>
<li>Notes (to see my workout plans)</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Strava (to track my workouts)</li>
</ul>
<p>This focus mode is triggered automatically when an Apple Workout is started.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="color-filters">Color Filters</h3>
<p>Another key feature I use is the grayscale color filter, which I keep on most of the time, and is mapped to my Action Button. Accessed via Accessibility settings, it turns the entire screen black &amp; white, making colorful apps like YouTube or social media far less appealing. Everything feels more &ldquo;boring,&rdquo; which is exactly the point: it discourages mindless scrolling. I toggle it off only when editing photos or needing accurate colors, but otherwise, it is my default. Combined with Focus Modes, my screen time has dipped, and I feel more present, especially during workouts and practice.</p>
<p>These software fixes are effective to a point, but they still live on a powerful, temptation-filled device. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m drawn to minimal hardware alternatives that inherently limit distractions through design.</p>

<h2 id="the-appeal-of-minimal-e-ink-devices">The Appeal of Minimal E-Ink Devices</h2>
<p>While my iPhone is a powerhouse, its high-refresh OLED screen and app ecosystem make it addictive by nature. Enter minimal e-ink devices: phone-sized gadgets with paper-like displays that refresh slowly, last days or weeks on a charge, and prioritize focus over flash. They&rsquo;re not full smartphone replacements (most lack native calling), but they handle essentials like messaging via apps, reading, and notes, without the dopamine hits. I love how e-ink feels and looks; it&rsquo;s soothing, eye-friendly, and transports me to a different mindset, much like flipping pages in a book.</p>
<h3 id="the-boox-palma-2-pro-my-top-contender">The Boox Palma 2 Pro: My Top Contender</h3>
<p>The Boox Palma series, especially the <a href="https://shop.boox.com/products/palma2pro">Palma 2 Pro</a>, is the one I&rsquo;m looking at the most. Its phone-like size makes it portable, but the e-ink display changes everything. The latest version features a color e-ink screen (Kaleido 3), which would make it more similar to a phone, so I might consider a different version that is only in black and white.</p>
<p>Running Android 15 with full Play Store access, it can function almost like a phone: install WhatsApp, Signal, or another app for messaging over Wi-Fi or 5G (with a hybrid SIM slot for data).</p>


<div class='callout callout-note'>
    <div class="callout-inner">
        
        <div class="callout-header">

            
            <strong>note</strong>

            
        </div>
        

        <div class="callout-body">
            With <a href="https://airmessage.org/">AirMessage</a>, one can use their Apple iMessages on any device, and even on the web!
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>It has 8GB RAM, 128GB storage (expandable), a camera for quick scans, and built-in speakers for podcasts or music. Battery life is stellar, lasting days or weeks thanks to e-ink&rsquo;s low power draw. The slower refresh rate (albeit very impressive for an e-ink display) naturally deters addictive habits like endless scrolling or gaming. Apps work, but they&rsquo;re not as engaging.</p>
<p>Drawbacks? Since it is an e-ink screen, dynamic content like YouTube can have refresh artifacts, but that is expected. The camera is basic, but has a nice vintage aesthetic that I enjoy. Still, for my needs such as reading ebooks, note-taking with the stylus, podcasts and music during workouts, and minimal communication, it feels ideal. It&rsquo;d complement my iPhone: use the Palma for most tasks and the iPhone for high-res media.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="wrapping-up-a-step-toward-mindful-tech">Wrapping Up: A Step Toward Mindful Tech</h2>
<p>My iPhone tweaks have helped curb distractions, boosting focus during practice, school, and workouts. But for true minimalism, I&rsquo;m leaning toward an e-ink companion like the Boox Palma 2 Pro. Its paper-like display and deliberate pace could transform how I interact with tech, making it a tool rather than a time-sink. If you&rsquo;re feeling phone-fatigued, start with software changes like Focus Modes, then consider going minimal. I&rsquo;ll update this post if I make the switch!</p>

A tour of the custom features I have built directly into my Neovim config, from a custom tabline and statusline to small QoL automations, showing how far you can go with minimal plugins.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been using Neovim since my junior year of high school, and have gone through the phases of emulating an IDE with lazy.nvim, using dozens of plugins, to my current setup, where I rely on very few plugins and use a lot of features I built in myself.</p>
<p>Let us take a look at said features, the ones implemented directly in my config rather than through a plugin.</p>
<h2 id="buffer-tabline">buffer tabline</h2>
<p>This was inspired (and almost directly copied) from <a href="https://adamthiede.com/posts/2025-07-06_no-more-neovim-plugins.html">Adam Thiede</a>&rsquo;s blog post, where he completely removed all of the neovim plugins he had been using.</p>

An introduction to the Arvelie date system, what draws me to it, and why I use it throughout this site.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/arvelie.html">Arvelie</a> calendar is a compact alternative date system developed by <a href="https://xxiivv.com">Devine Lu Linvega</a>. It is designed to emphasize regularity, computational simplicity, and personal contextualization of time.</p>
<p>Arvelie dates are written in the format <code>YYMDD</code>. The year count begins at zero relative to an arbitrary but meaningful reference point, most commonly the start of a project or journal. The calendar consists of 26 months, each represented by a letter of the Latin alphabet (A–Z). Every month contains exactly two weeks of seven days, resulting in a uniform structure of 14 days per month.</p>
<p>Using 2025 as the base year, the following examples illustrate the system:</p>
<ul>
<li>January 1, 2025 -&gt; <code>00A00</code></li>
<li>April 1, 2025 -&gt; <code>00G06</code></li>
<li>October 5, 2025 -&gt; <code>00T11</code></li>
<li>December 31, 2025 -&gt; <code>00&#43;00</code></li>
<li>March 15, 2027 -&gt; <code>02F03</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conceptual-motivation">conceptual motivation</h2>
<p>A defining characteristic of the Arvelie system is its rejection of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing)">absolute historical epoch</a> in favor of a relative temporal framework. Conventional calendars typically anchor time to distant historical or religious events, such as AD (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini">Anno Domini</a>) or BC (Before Christ). By contrast, Arvelie permits the user to define year zero according to personal significance—for example, the inception of a website or creative project.</p>
<p>This relativity aligns closely with everyday human conceptions of time. Age is measured from birth, professional experience from a start date, and relationships through the use of anniversaries. Arvelie formalizes this intuitive practice, shifting emphasis from an abstract global timeline to the duration and development of a specific endeavor. For this reason, it is particularly well suited to a <a href="/posts/what-is-this-website/">personal site such as the one you are currently reading</a>.</p>
<p>Structurally, the calendar is notable for its uniformity: 26 identical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnight">fortnights</a> per year. This eliminates irregular month lengths and exception-heavy rules, improves lexical date sorting, and yields concise, visually distinctive date strings that remain legible.</p>
<h2 id="intercalary-days">intercalary days</h2>
<p>The Arvelie calendar accounts for surplus solar days through the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation_(timekeeping)">intercalary days</a>. After the final month (<code>Z</code>), a special Year Day is inserted, denoted as <code>+00</code>. This day exists outside the standard month–week structure and represents the final day of the year, e.g., <code>2025-12-31</code> is translated to <code>00&#43;00</code>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year">leap years</a>, an additional Leap Day follows the Year Day and is written as <code>+01</code>. Like the Year Day, it does not belong to any month. For example, in 2028, <code>2028-12-30</code> corresponds to <code>03&#43;00</code> (Year Day), and <code>2028-12-31</code> corresponds to <code>03&#43;01</code> (Leap Day).</p>
<h2 id="implementation-on-this-site">implementation on this site</h2>
<p>This site launched in 2025, which is therefore designated as year <code>00</code>. All dates published during 2025 begin with <code>00</code>, incrementing to <code>01</code> in 2026, and so forth. This approach explicitly ties the calendar to the lifespan of the project itself.</p>
<p>Technically, the system is implemented using a Hugo partial (<code>date-arvelie.html</code>) that converts standard post dates within my HTML templates, as well as a shortcode (<code>arvelie.html</code>) for direct use in Markdown. The examples above were generated using this shortcode. The underlying logic draws significant inspiration from the Arvelie CLI implementation by <a href="https://tjex.net/posts/the-arveelie-time-system/">Tillman Jex</a>.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">final thoughts</h2>
<p>While the Arvelie date system represents only a modest departure from conventional calendrical practice, its impact on the tone and coherence of this site is substantial. By allowing timekeeping to evolve alongside the project it documents, Arvelie transforms dates from static timestamps into indicators of growth and duration. As the year count advances from zero, the calendar will not merely record when content was created, but how far this project has progressed over time.</p>

An exploration of the concepts of the Garden and the Stream as they relate to personal websites, examining how my site incorporates elements of both and why it cannot be confined to a single category.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This website was created on November 4th, 2025 (00V13).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Depending on when you are reading this, that may have been very recently or a long time ago.</p>
<p>In his 2015 keynote <a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/"><em>The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral</em></a>,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Mike Caulfield describes two different philosophies for the web: the <code>Garden</code> and the <code>Stream</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Garden</code> is the web as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology">topology</a>. It uses links, slow growth, evergreen notes,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and things arranged next to each other instead of in a timeline.</p>
<p>In a true garden, you walk around. You follow a path because one thought feels close to another, not because it was posted last Tuesday. Nothing is ever truly <em>old</em>; it just sits there until someone stumbles across it again and decides to water it. Dates, if they exist at all, are secondary. The shape of the space matters more than the arrow of time.</p>
<p>My website borrows a few habits from the garden.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are interconnected pages that live outside of time and keep growing, such as <a href="/about/">/about</a>, <a href="/colophon/">/colophon</a>, <a href="/uses/">/uses</a>, <a href="/now/">/now</a>, and more.</li>
<li>My homepage displays a few featured writings, not sorted chronologically and absolutely no paginator.</li>
<li>Ideas for my writings often start as tiny seedlings in the <a href="/micro/">microblog</a>, and later blossom into fully-fledged writings.</li>
<li>Every page on my website can be updated, tended to. I can come back and edit an old post, add a paragraph, fix a broken thought, and the <code>updated on</code> line at the bottom changes accordingly.</li>
<li>Pages are connected to each other through <a href="/tags/">tags</a> and manual links.</li>
</ul>
<p>This site is <em>not</em> a <code>Garden</code>, though.</p>
<p>The <code>Stream</code> is chronology, newest-first, posts that appear and then slide away forever. You see it on most social media, from Instagram to X.</p>
<p>In the stream you don&rsquo;t explore; you stand in the current and let things rush past. The only organizing principle is simply &ldquo;when&rdquo;, and once something scrolls off the front page it might as well not exist anymore.</p>
<p>My website still carries a lot of the stream in its bones.</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost every post on my website includes dates:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/posts/">/posts</a> have a <code>published on</code> date, and are sorted accordingly.</li>
<li>My <a href="/micro/">micro blog</a> is sorted chronologically, with the newest entries on top.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most writings are written, published, and then left exactly as they were on the day they went live.</li>
</ul>
<p>This site is <em>not</em> a <code>Stream</code>, though.</p>
<p>It lives in the middle.</p>
<p>Some corners are cultivated beds, some corners a fast-moving river, and most of the land is just ordinary ground where both weeds and flowers grow however they want.</p>
<p>I am fine with that. I do not need to pick a side or finish the transformation.</p>
<p>This place is simply mine. My little corner of the web. It can keep changing, shape-shifting, as long as I am still here to tend to it.</p>
<p>Thanks for walking through it with me, whenever you happened to arrive.</p>
<p>If you feel like staying longer, here are a few nice spots:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/about/">about</a> me</li>
<li>what I&rsquo;m <a href="/now/">up to right now</a></li>
<li>the <a href="/uses/">gear</a> I use</li>
<li>how <a href="/colophon/">this site is made</a></li>
<li>my small collection of <a href="/links/">bookmarks</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Or simply wander my <a href="/posts/">writings</a> and the <a href="/micro/">micro blog</a>.</p>
<p>Take your time, and I will see you around.</p>

A retelling of my experience learning Vim, and why it is worth trying for yourself.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><code>hhhhjjjkkklllllhhlhjkkkjjjj5wxxd5jxkkkkk:wq</code></p>
<p>No, my dog did not walk across my keyboard. That was me, in my first few hours of Vim, desperately trying to escape a blank Neovim buffer.</p>
<h2 id="the-before-times">the before times</h2>
<p>I started programming in 7th grade. Like most beginners, my setup was <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>, a mouse, and the arrow keys. It worked, but something always felt off.</p>
<p>Every time I needed to edit code a few lines away, I would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lift my hand off the keyboard</li>
<li>Hunt for the mouse</li>
<li>Drag the cursor to exactly the right spot (usually missing the first time)</li>
<li>Click</li>
<li>Put my hand back on the keyboard</li>
<li>Repeat 47 times per coding session</li>
</ol>
<p>It was exhausting. I felt like I was doing finger gymnastics just to write a for-loop.</p>
<p>My dad, on the other hand, was a different species of programmer. I&rsquo;d watch him hammer away for hours with this constant clack-clack-clack from his absurdly loud mechanical keyboard, never touching a mouse. One day I asked what editor he used.</p>
<p>His exact words that would change my life, delivered with the smug satisfaction only a true programmer can muster, were:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;I use Vim, btw.&#34;
</code></pre><h2 id="the-youtube-rabbit-hole">the youtube rabbit hole</h2>
<p>Fast forward a couple of years. I was deep into programmer YouTube, from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship/">Fireship&rsquo;s</a> 100-second videos to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen">ThePrimeagen</a> flying around his editor like he&rsquo;s possessed by the ghost of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>. Every other video I saw mentioned Vim. The memes were relentless:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Only real programmers use Vim&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;There are two types of developers: those who use Vim and those who will&hellip;eventually&rdquo;</li>
<li>The eternal &ldquo;HOW DO I EXIT VIM???&rdquo; panic</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually the peer pressure won. I installed <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, cracked my knuckles, and typed the fateful command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">nvim
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="the-trauma">the trauma</h2>
<p>My screen went blank. Nothing worked.</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrow keys? Dead.</li>
<li>WASD? Nothing.</li>
<li>Random smashing of every key I could reach? Still nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was trapped. I legitimately restarted my computer because I could not figure out how to quit. (Yes, I know now it&rsquo;s <code>:qa!</code> or <code>ZZ</code> or a multitude of other commands. No, I did not know that then.)</p>
<h2 id="the-breakthrough">the breakthrough</h2>
<p>After recovering from the PTSD, I actually started learning.</p>
<p>Turns out in Vim, the &ldquo;arrow keys&rdquo; are hjkl:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>h</code> &ndash;&gt; left</li>
<li><code>j</code> &ndash;&gt; down</li>
<li><code>k</code> &ndash;&gt; up</li>
<li><code>l</code> &ndash;&gt; right</li>
</ul>
<p>It felt wrong, like trying to play piano with my elbows. My muscle memory screamed in protest.</p>
<p>But then&hellip;something clicked.</p>
<p>I learned you could prefix motions with numbers: <code>5j</code> goes down 5 lines, <code>10k</code> goes up 10. I learned the basic modes: <code>Normal</code> (used to move around), <code>Insert</code> (used to type), and <code>Visual</code> (used to select text). I discovered macros (record a sequence once, replay it forever with <code>@</code>). I even found netrw, Vim&rsquo;s built-in file explorer. So many other motions made it extremely easy and fast to navigate a file.</p>
<p>Within a week I caught myself trying to <code>5j6w</code> my way through Google Docs for a school essay.</p>
<p>Everything felt&hellip;creamy. (You&rsquo;ll only understand that word if you&rsquo;ve experienced the same brain rewrite.)</p>
<p>Suddenly I was not fighting my tools anymore. My hands and brain were finally speaking the same language. I could think &ndash;&gt; type &ndash;&gt; execute at something close to the speed of thought.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-lesson">the real lesson</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing most Vim evangelists get wrong:</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to use Vim or Neovim to benefit from Vim.</p>
<p>The motions are the superpower. Almost every major editor and IDE has Vim keybinding plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li>VS Code has <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim">VSCodeVim</a></li>
<li>JetBrains IDEs have <a href="https://lp.jetbrains.com/ideavim/">IdeaVim</a></li>
<li>Sublime Text has <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/vintage.html">Vintage mode</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Start there. Fall in love with the motions in an editor you already know. Then, if you want to go deeper, dip your toes into actual Neovim.</p>
<p>Helpful resources if you&rsquo;re curious:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim">kickstart.nvim</a>: great starter config. It is not a distro, but rather teaches you how to make your own configuration</li>
<li>ThePrimeagen&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R">&ldquo;Vim As Your Editor&rdquo;</a> series: very beginner-friendly and in-depth tutorials for the vim motions</li>
<li>My neovim config (found in my <a href="https://github.com/MichaelYoDev/.config">.config</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to marry Vim. You don&rsquo;t even have to date it exclusively.</p>
<p>Just take it out for a week, and see if the sparks fly.</p>
<p>Even if you break up afterward, you&rsquo;ll walk away with better editing skills in whatever tool you actually use.</p>
<p>Vim broke my brain, and I&rsquo;m better for it.</p>
<p>Now if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I have to go <code>dd</code> the memory of ever using a mouse again.</p>
<p><code>:wq</code></p>

A reflection on my emotions and thoughts after my final high school marching band competition.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>November 23rd, 2025. WBA Grand Championships. My last day of high school marching band.</p>
<p>I started crying in Part 4, during the drum break. After my flugelhorn solo, I knelt on the sideline while the rest of the brass did their dance break. When they turned and looked toward me, seeing their smiling faces started the waterworks. Later, during the outro after Part 5 where my line ran one of the river tarps around the field, the tears would not stop. At the last hold, I could hear people from the color guard sobbing.</p>
<p>I remember our last moments on the field: feeling the emotions overcome me, trying and failing to maintain a smile for the audience as the tears flowed. Then, as we began pushing off the field, I remember yelling with joy, hugging my closest friends, and feeling a mixture of pride and sorrow. Proud of our band putting on the best performance we could have done. Sad that my high school marching band career was over.</p>
<p>Thinking about those final moments on the field, I remember the same events my freshman year. The same pride and sorrow. At the time, I did not think any other year would surpass it. That was my first year in marching band, and it left a lasting impression on me. My senior year, though, was even better.</p>
<p>I had a really close group of friends this year. We called ourselves the &ldquo;5 guys&rdquo;, and got a <em>tuff</em> photo at every competition. They are all high-achieving musicians and marchers, just like me, and it was great hanging out with them. Now, with marching season over, I hope we still stay close even though we don&rsquo;t have an activity bringing us together.</p>
<p>Life feels so strange without marching band. A feeling I haven&rsquo;t felt since freshman year. It&rsquo;s like a part of my life is empty; Wednesday evenings are occupied by homework and violin practice, not marching band. Saturdays are free for sleeping in, reading at the local bookstore, or taking a trip to the city, not marching band.</p>
<p>Looking back, I am so glad I did marching band. Some of my closest friendships came out of it. I made so many memories, documented on my camera roll and journal.</p>
<p>I will never have another high school marching band experience.</p>
<p>Last one, best one.</p>

An exploration of how music preserves emotions and memories, illustrated through several personal examples.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="music-to-me">music, to me.</h2>
<p><em>“Music is a universal language”</em> is a phrase I have heard endlessly, but which has always rung hollow.</p>
<p><em>How can I actually talk to someone with music?</em> young me wondered. <em>Does that mean I don’t need to learn English?</em></p>
<p>For me, a more accurate version is: <em>&ldquo;Music is a medium to express and share emotions&rdquo;</em>. Let me show what I mean.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="brahms-violin-sonata-no-2-in-a-major-op-100-1st-mvt">brahms: violin sonata no. 2 in a major, op. 100, 1st mvt</h2>
<p>I first heard this piece played in a student recital at a violin summer festival I attended.</p>
<p>When I hear the opening piano part, I immediately feel a wave of nostalgia wash over me. That happened the first time I heard it, and every time since. It is a very interesting sensation, because it does not take me to a place or time I have been before. It just bathes me in the emotions of longing, melancholy, and a hint of joy.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://song.link/i/693110291">my favorite recording</a> of this piece by Itzhak Perlman and Vladimir Ashkenazy.</p>
<h2 id="just-the-two-of-us-grover-washington">Just the Two of Us (Grover Washington)</h2>
<p>This is the sound of the last month of sophomore year. That period of time was very special to me. It is hard to put into words, but it felt removed from the timeline of my life.</p>
<p>When I hear it, I remember walking around campus with my friends prior to the AP CSP exam. I remember stepping off of campus for the last time that year, feeling that my life was moving on. And I remember being in that bubble of time, enjoying the moment.</p>
<p>If my life was a film, that portion would have a slightly different tint that no other scene would share.</p>
<p>My jazz combo performed this song, as well as a <a href="https://song.link/us/i/1682357121">From the Start</a> and a few others, at my school&rsquo;s Senior Awards.</p>
<p>I listen to it whenever I want to be transported back to that vibe, or when it feels hard to keep living and looking forward.</p>
<p>Listen to this one <a href="https://song.link/i/391725517">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="suk-love-song-from-6-pieces-op-7">Suk: Love Song from 6 Pieces, Op. 7</h2>
<p>The title of the piece perfectly encompasses what I feel from this piece: love.</p>
<p>Just like the Brahms, I first heard this piece at a violin summer festival, performed as an encore by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGp9rx6U2iQ">Ray Ushikubo</a>.</p>
<p>The warmth of D-flat major pairs incredibly with the melody of the first section. The feeling of love builds up and becomes so intense, entangled with the feeling of heartbreak: tender and raw. In the second section, it develops into a brighter and more wistful feeling, as if reminiscing on the happy memories with a past lover. It returns back to the first section, but with more movement in the piano accompaniment, as if they are starting to move on, with the heartbreak fading slowly. The piece ends with a final thought: that everything will be okay.</p>
<p>This piece got me through a lot of difficult times. It is my favorite piece of music, and I can feel myself going through all the emotions whenever I perform it. The way I feel after a performance of this piece is incomparable to any other.</p>
<p>Love. Hope. Comfort.</p>
<p>Take a listen to my <a href="https://song.link/i/1577946597">favorite recording</a> of this piece by Janine Jansen.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Each of these pieces marks a different chapter in my life, and different emotions I have felt throughout it: moments of longing, of connection, of healing. Music has a way of holding time still, of letting us return to who we once were, and who we are, and who we will become.</p>
<p>These three pieces are a small selection from my <em>reflection</em> playlist, where each piece or song carries a memory or emotion that is special to me.</p>

A recounting of a dream I had about love and joy, and the subsequent loss of it upon waking.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The memories are … fuzzy.</p>
<p>I can see her face, half-lit by the dream’s last streetlamp. I remember the clothes she wore, and the feeling of her wool coat brushing my wrist as we walked, hand in hand. I can feel the soft touch of her fingers on my cheek. I can picture the slight redness of her nose and cheeks from the cold, along with her beautiful smile. I can taste the meal we shared at the restaurant. I can hear the click of her camera, an old digital camera that looked like a Fujifilm.</p>
<p>I woke feeling joy. True joy. And love. The kind that inspires the butterflies in your stomach to flutter to their hearts’ content.</p>
<p>Then the details slipped, the memories faded, and the joy dissipated into the old familiar hush of my bedroom.</p>
<p>I searched my memories: no texts. No photos. No yesterday. It was just a dream.</p>
<p>All I was left with was the pain of emptiness and loneliness, a hopefulness for the happiness I could someday have, and an image of her face, slowly fading.</p>
<p>I do not know why God showed me what He did. All I know is that, through the pain and sadness, I look forward to the joy and love I will experience someday.</p>
<p>Someday.</p>
<p>Until then.</p>
