How can I actually talk to someone with music? young me wondered. Does that mean I don’t need to learn English?
A more accurate version, for me, is: &ldquo;Music is a medium to express and share emotions&rdquo;. Let me show you some examples.

<h2 id="brahms-violin-sonata-no-2-in-a-major-op-100-1st-mvt">Brahms: Violin Sonata No. 2 in A Major, Op. 100, 1st mvt</h2>
<p>I first heard this piece played in a student recital at a violin summer festival I attended.</p>
<p>When I hear the opening piano part, I immediately feel a wave of nostalgia wash over me. That happened the first time I heard it, and every time since. It is a very interesting sensation, because it does not take me to a place or time I have been before, unlike some of the other music in this post. It just gives me that feeling. Longing, melancholy, with a hint of joy.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://song.link/i/693110291">my favorite recording</a> of this piece by Itzhak Perlman and Vladimir Ashkenazy.</p>
<h2 id="just-the-two-of-us-grover-washington">Just the Two of Us (Grover Washington)</h2>
<p>This is the sound of the last month of sophomore year. That period of time was very special to me. It is hard to put into words, but it felt like a time removed from the timeline of my life.</p>
<p>When I hear it, I remember walking around campus with my friends prior to the AP CSP exam. I remember stepping off of campus for the last time that year, feeling that my life was moving on. And I remember being in that bubble of time, enjoying the moment. If my life was a film, that portion would have a slightly different tint that no other part of the film would have.</p>
<p>My jazz combo performed this song, as well as a <a href="https://song.link/us/i/1682357121">From the Start</a> and a few others, at my school&rsquo;s Senior Awards.</p>
<p>I listen to this one whenever I want to be transported to that vibe, or when it feels hard to keep living and looking forward.</p>
<p>Listen to this one <a href="https://song.link/i/391725517">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="suk-love-song-from-6-pieces-op-7">Suk: Love Song from 6 Pieces, Op. 7</h2>
<p>The title of the piece perfectly encompasses what I feel from this piece: love.</p>
<p>Just like the Brahms, I first heard this piece at a violin summer festival, performed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGp9rx6U2iQ">Ray Ushikubo</a>.</p>
<p>The warmth of the key, D-flat major, is paired incredibly with the melody of the first section. The feeling of love builds up and becomes so intense, entangled with the feeling of heartbreak. In the second section, it develops into a brighter and more wistful feeling, as if reminiscing on the happy memories with a past lover. It returns back to the first section, but with more movement in the piano accompaniment, as if they are starting to move on while still feeling the love and heartbreak. The piece ends with a final thought, that everything will be okay.</p>
<p>This piece got me through a lot of difficult times. It is my favorite piece of music, and I can feel myself going through all the emotions whenever I perform it. The way I feel after a performance of this piece is incomparable to any other.</p>
<p>Love. Hope. Comfort.</p>
<p>Take a listen to my <a href="https://song.link/i/1577946597">favorite recording</a> of this piece by Janine Jansen.</p>
