On my iPhone 16 Pro, my average daily screen time hovers around 3 hours. Not too high, but I still feel it pulling me away from real-life priorities. The biggest culprits? Endless YouTube rabbit holes, constant texting, and aimless web surfing. These distractions have hit hardest during my practice sessions, where I need undivided focus but often find myself checking notifications mid-routine. It&rsquo;s led to fragmented concentration, less productive practice sessions, and a nagging sense that my phone can be more of a hindrance than a help.</p><p>To combat this, I&rsquo;ve implemented some built-in iOS features to make my iPhone less addictive. While these tweaks aren&rsquo;t a complete cure, they&rsquo;ve helped reclaim some mental space. But lately, I&rsquo;ve been eyeing hardware alternatives, specifically minimal devices with e-ink displays that promise a calmer, less stimulating experience. I absolutely love the e-ink tech from my Kindle; it feels gentle on the eyes and evokes a sense of tranquility that&rsquo;s worlds apart from the vibrant, notification-pinging glow of my iPhone. Below, I&rsquo;ll share my current setup and why devices like the Boox Palma (and a few others) are calling my name.</p><h2 id=my-iphone-tweaks-focus-modes-and-grayscale>My iPhone Tweaks: Focus Modes and Grayscale</h2><p>Apple&rsquo;s Focus Modes have been a game-changer for tailoring my phone to specific activities. I have three main ones: Practice, School, and Workout. Each allows only essential apps on a one-page setup and limits notifications, silencing the rest. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown:</p><h3 id=practice-focus>Practice Focus</h3><p>This is for my dedicated practice time.</p><p>Apps on the home screen:</p><ul><li>Andante (my practice tracker)</li><li>TE Tuner (for tuning my instruments)</li><li>Voice Memos (to record myself)</li><li>Apple Music (for listening to recordings)</li></ul><p>Notifications are limited to Calendar reminders, so no social media or random pings to derail me.</p><p>This focus mode is triggered manually, through the shortcut at the top of each home page.</p><figure><img src=/images/posts/practice-focus.avif></figure><h3 id=school-focus>School Focus</h3><p>This focus mode keeps me productive during classes or study sessions.</p><p>Apps on the home screen:</p><ul><li>Google Drive (to access school files)</li><li>Infinite Campus (for checking grades)</li><li>Canvas (for accessing assignments)</li><li>Gmail (for my school email)</li><li>Apple Music (for my study playlist)</li></ul><p>Widgets on the home screen:</p><ul><li>Bell Schedule (so I&rsquo;m not late to class)</li><li>Homework (see my homework todo list)</li><li>Stations (put on a Music station)</li></ul><p>Notifications come through for the aforementioned apps, so I can stay on top of assignments without extras.</p><p>This focus mode is triggered automatically by location when I am at my school, or manually through the shortcut at the top of each home page.</p><figure><img src=/images/posts/school-focus.avif></figure><h3 id=workout-focus>Workout Focus</h3><p>This focus mode is for my workouts, whether lifting at the gym or running.</p><p>Apps on the home screen:</p><ul><li>Fit19 (the gym I frequent)</li><li>Apple Fitness (to see my activity)</li><li>Podcasts</li><li>Notes (to see my workout plans)</li><li>Music</li><li>Strava (to track my workouts)</li></ul><p>This focus mode is triggered automatically when an Apple Workout is started.</p><figure><img src=/images/posts/workout-focus.avif></figure><h3 id=color-filters>Color Filters</h3><p>Another key feature I use is the grayscale color filter, which I keep on most of the time, and is mapped to my Action Button. Accessed via Accessibility settings, it turns the entire screen black & white, making colorful apps like YouTube or social media far less appealing. Everything feels more &ldquo;boring,&rdquo; which is exactly the point: it discourages mindless scrolling. I toggle it off only when editing photos or needing accurate colors, but otherwise, it is my default. Combined with Focus Modes, my screen time has dipped, and I feel more present, especially during workouts and practice.</p><p>These software fixes are effective to a point, but they still live on a powerful, temptation-filled device. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m drawn to minimal hardware alternatives that inherently limit distractions through design.</p><hr><h2 id=the-appeal-of-minimal-e-ink-devices>The Appeal of Minimal E-Ink Devices</h2><p>While my iPhone is a powerhouse, its high-refresh OLED screen and app ecosystem make it addictive by nature. Enter minimal e-ink devices: phone-sized gadgets with paper-like displays that refresh slowly, last days or weeks on a charge, and prioritize focus over flash. They&rsquo;re not full smartphone replacements (most lack native calling), but they handle essentials like messaging via apps, reading, and notes, without the dopamine hits. I love how e-ink feels and looks; it&rsquo;s soothing, eye-friendly, and transports me to a different mindset, much like flipping pages in a book.</p><h3 id=the-boox-palma-2-pro-my-top-contender>The Boox Palma 2 Pro: My Top Contender</h3><p>The Boox Palma series, especially the <a href=https://shop.boox.com/products/palma2pro>Palma 2 Pro</a>, is the one I&rsquo;m looking at the most. Its phone-like size makes it portable, but the e-ink display changes everything. The latest version features a color e-ink screen (Kaleido 3), which would make it more similar to a phone, so I might consider a different version that is only in black and white.</p><p>Running Android 15 with full Play Store access, it can function almost like a phone: install WhatsApp, Signal, or another app for messaging over Wi-Fi or 5G (with a hybrid SIM slot for data).</p><div class='callout callout-note'><div class=callout-inner><div class=callout-header><strong>note</strong></div><div class=callout-body>With <a href=https://airmessage.org/>AirMessage</a>, one can use their Apple iMessages on any device, and even on the web!</div></div></div><p>It has 8GB RAM, 128GB storage (expandable), a camera for quick scans, and built-in speakers for podcasts or music. Battery life is stellar, lasting days or weeks thanks to e-ink&rsquo;s low power draw. The slower refresh rate (albeit very impressive for an e-ink display) naturally deters addictive habits like endless scrolling or gaming. Apps work, but they&rsquo;re not as engaging.</p><p>Drawbacks? Since it is an e-ink screen, dynamic content like YouTube can have refresh artifacts, but that is expected. The camera is basic, but has a nice vintage aesthetic that I enjoy. Still, for my needs such as reading ebooks, note-taking with the stylus, podcasts and music during workouts, and minimal communication, it feels ideal. It&rsquo;d complement my iPhone: use the Palma for most tasks and the iPhone for high-res media.</p><h3 id=other-options-for-further-research>Other Options for Further Research</h3><ul><li><a href=https://mudita.com/products/phones/mudita-kompakt/>Mudita Kompakt</a></li><li><a href=https://minimalcompany.com/>Minimal Phone</a></li><li><a href=https://www.thelightphone.com/shop/products/light-phone-iii>Light Phone III</a></li><li><a href=https://www.thelightphone.com/shop/products/light-phone-ii-light-gray>Light Phone II</a></li></ul><h2 id=wrapping-up-a-step-toward-mindful-tech>Wrapping Up: A Step Toward Mindful Tech</h2><p>My iPhone tweaks have helped curb distractions, boosting focus during practice, school, and workouts. But for true minimalism, I&rsquo;m leaning toward an e-ink companion like the Boox Palma 2 Pro. Its paper-like display and deliberate pace could transform how I interact with tech, making it a tool rather than a time-sink. If you&rsquo;re feeling phone-fatigued, start with software changes like Focus Modes, then consider going minimal. I&rsquo;ll update this post if I make the switch!</p></section><hr><div class=meta>Updated on 01A05</div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><strong>Tagged with:</strong></li><li><a href=/%20tags/tech>tech</a></li><li><a href=/%20tags/productivity>productivity</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=footer-wrapper><div class=footer-upper><div class=footer-left><div class=footer-cc>© 2025-2026
